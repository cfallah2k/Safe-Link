- Shows stakeholder-specific messaging and interface
- Redirects to role-specific OTP authentication

**Regular User Detection:**
- Any code without `'SAFE'` or `'LINK'` keywords is treated as regular user
- Shows "create new code" option for new users
- Standard user interface and messaging
- Access to main app features after authentication

**Code Patterns:**
- **Stakeholder Codes**: `SAFELINK_*_2024` format (e.g., `SAFELINK_ADMIN_2024`)
- **Regular User Codes**: 8-character alphanumeric (e.g., `A1B2C3D4`)

This smart detection allows the system to automatically adapt the interface based on what the user is typing, providing the appropriate experience for each user type without requiring manual selection.
